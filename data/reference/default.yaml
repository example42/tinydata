# This reference data shows all the possible tinydata settings for a sample application (called 'reference')
#
# The main APPNAME::settings key below is looked up by the tp_lookup function in tp module manifests.
# It's an hash whose values are looked up in deep merge mode across the hierarchies
# defined in the hiera.yaml configuration file specific for each managed app.
#
# You don't have to set all these settings, but be sure that what's set is correct, otherwise tp may try to do weird
# things or plainly fail with wrong data.

# Settings marked with v3 are used by every version of tp module (or since they've been introduced, refer to tp CHANGELOG for details)
#   They are going to be deprecated (but still supported) from tp 4
# Settings marked with v4 are used by tp module starting from version 4.
#   When both settings v3 and v4 are set, v4 ones are used (from tp 4 onwards)
#   Some v4 settings are used, as technology preview, in tp version 3.8.0 onwards.

# Note that in every template used by the tp::conf define you can access to these settings
# (so that you can automatically configure in your own templates the right paths and names for
# different underlying OSes) via the $settings variable (an hash with the settings values merged across the hierarchy).
# For example to get the name of the user running a given app (as a service) you can use something like:
#   User <%= @settings['service']['main']['process_user'] %> # In erb templates
#   User <%= $settings['service']['main']['process_user'] %> # In epp templates
# This works also for nested keys like:
#   Port: <%= $settings['ports']['main']['port'] %>
#   Protocol: <%= $settings['ports']['main']['protocol'] %>
# Note: Be sure the referred settings (and subkeys) exist in your tinydata to avoid errors like:
# Evaluation Error: Operator '[]' is not applicable to an Undef Value. 

# You can override these settings directly from tp defines using the parameter settings_hash (legacy) or,
# starting from tp 4, also the parameter my_settings. Their content must be an hash, with the same structure
# of the data below and is merged with what comes from tinydata (you can override or set new settings).

# Here 'reference' is a sample application name, whose tinydata is expected to be placed under the
# directory data/reference/. Change it according to the app the tinydata is made for, or, better,
# run the scripts/moduledata_clone.sh script to scaffold the tinydata for a new app, based on the
# tinydata of an existing app: scripts/moduledata_clone.sh existing_app new_app
# ProTip: Use as existing app one of the example ones like: "sample", "sample_desktop" ...
