# This file defines the hierathy to follow when looking for tinydata settings
# Note that even if it's called like a normal Hiera 3 configuration files
# and has a similar logic it's NOT a Hiera configuration and is not used by Hiera
# This file is actually used by the tp_slookuo function and has the following
# limitation:
# Variables interpolation is done ONLY for the following variables:
# - Fact $::operatingsystemmajrelease
# - Fact $::operatingsystemrelease
# - Fact $::operatingsystem
# - Fact $::osfamily
# - Argument $repo of the tp::install define (defaults to 'upstream' is upstream_repo is true)
# - $title of the tp::install (or other tp::*) define

# As in Hiera lookup is done from top to bottom, according to the merge method specified
# when calling the tp_lookup function
# Starting from tp version 3.8 the merge method has changed from 'merge' to 'deep_merge'
# This is not expected to have any impact on the existing TinyData but is required by
# the more complex tinydata v4 settings

# The lower levels in the hierarchy generally use a default to configure general settings
# valid for all the apps (and in some cases different for OS and OS versions)

# For each app you can have a different hiera.yaml with more or less levels
# A minimal recommended hierarchy is as follows:
# - "%{title}/osfamily/%{osfamily}%{operatingsystemmajrelease}"
# - "%{title}/osfamily/%{osfamily}"
# - "%{title}/default"
# - "default/%{operatingsystem}%{operatingsystemmajrelease}"
# - "default/%{operatingsystem}"
# - default

# That maps respectively to the following files in the tinydata module:
# Example with the app redis on RedHat9
# - data/redis/osfamily/RedHat9.yaml
# - data/redis/osfamily/RedHat.yaml
# - data/redis/default.yaml
# - data/default/RedHat9.yaml
# - data/default/RedHat.yaml
# - data/default.yaml
